      <p>A few weeks ago I was discussing the decline of Clayton Kershaw with a few folks on Twitter. Someone in the conversation posted his average fastball velocity for each year of his career. If you haven’t been paying attention, the most noticeable thing about Kershaw in the last two seasons, besides his recurring back injuries, has been the decrease in the speed of his fastball. It has dropped nearly three miles per hour since he put up the best numbers of his career in 2015.</p>

<p>Is a Tommy John surgery in Kershaw’s future? There’s no telling. But I want to focus on what someone said in response to this data. It’s something we’ve all seen more than a few times. It goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speed isn’t the only important thing! Greg Maddux barely threw above 90mph in his prime!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve heard others call it the <em>Greg Maddux Comp.</em> A good pitcher with great command minus the blistering heat can be just like Maddux, right? Wrong. It’s easy to drop the comparison in a discussion, but it’s a disservice to Maddux’s career. In the case of this Twitter conversation, the same person that made the <em>Greg Maddux Comp</em> said that Kershaw would be fine because he was “crafty enough” to combine his breaking balls with his ability to locate his fastball. Let’s compare Maddux’s peak to Kerhsaw’s peak. Since Kershaw will be 31 next season, it’s very unlikely he will have a better five-year peak than his 2011-2015 seasons. We can assume with high certainty that he has peaked.</p>

<p>Since not everyone agrees on what model of pitching WAR is best, I’ve decided to include both fWAR and a 50/50 blend of FIP-based and RA9-based WAR. I’ll call it mWAR for mixed-WAR. As an aside, I should mention that I’m not totally sure how I feel about FIP-based WAR. Why? Because it assumes that weak contact is out of a pitcher’s control. This might be true in some cases, but some pitchers, like Tom Glavine, outperformed their peripherals for most of their career. It’s not a fluke. I think it’s a flaw with FIP-based pitching WAR in the same way I think <a href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/drc-deserved-runs-created/">BP’s new DRC+ metric</a> undervalues singles hitters like Ichiro. True pitching value comes somewhere in between FIP-based and RA9-based. You can quote me on that.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are their peaks compared:</p>

<p><sub><sup>*Maddux missed around 20 games dude to strike-shortened seasons in 1994 and 1995</sup></sub></p>

<p>Two things really stand out: prime Kershaw struck out batters at a much higher rate than prime Maddux and prime Maddux vastly outperformed prime Kershaw in ERA+. The difference in K% makes sense, because Kershaw isn’t a control pitcher. Kershaw is a strikeout pitcher. Kershaw’s FIP during his peak was also about two tenths lower than Maddux’s. The reason Maddux still has a higher fWAR is probably because league average FIP was higher and Maddux also got more fielding runs. So, obviously, Kershaw and Maddux had different peaks. Their value is similar in fWAR but RA9 WAR values Maddux far more. The blend of RA9 and FIP WAR still favors Maddux too. Kershaw strikes out more people. Maddux allows less runs and walks less people. They’re not the same kind of pitcher.</p>

<p>Also, Maddux would have at least another 4 or 5 wins to add to his WAR total and that’s a low estimate since that was his prime. That would give him one of the greatest 5-year peaks for any pitcher… <em>ever.</em> All without striking out at a high rate.</p>

<p>So now that we know Maddux and Kershaw had different peaks. Let’s take a look at other control pitchers throughout history. As I’ve already said, Kershaw isn’t going to match his 2011-2015 peak. I say that with 100% confidence, so instead I decided to compare his current career numbers to other pitcher’s career numbers.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen pitchers with a walk rate less than 5.5% because I can. Maddux is tied for 2nd in this list, only behind Saberhagen. From this chart, you can see that Maddux’s ERA+ doesn’t stand out above the rest of my arbitrarily defined control pitchers. What does stand out is his WAR. His total career WAR is twice as much as other <em>control</em> pitchers. You could argue that this is because of his large amount of innings pitched(5008.1) and you’d be right. But take note of the IP count of the other <em>control</em> pitchers. Fergie Jenkins is the only one who is within two or three seasons of Maddux in innings pitched. Maddux pitched with stellar control for his entire career and that was how he accumulated so much value. It’s hard to be a control pitcher for a long time, because as your speed drops your control needs to increase tenfold.</p>

<p>Just in case you aren’t convinced because his IP is much higher than the other <em>control</em> pitchers, I also included the last column to show the best five year stretch of each pitcher’s career. Once again, Maddux is at the top, and it’s by a wide margin. Halladay would need a season of 7.4 mWAR just to match Maddux’s best 5 year peak. That’s incredible when you consider that Halladay is a shoo-in HOF pitcher in his own right. No other <em>control</em> pitcher has really come close to matching Maddux’s career value and peak value. That’s insane! Can we really expect Kershaw to put up great numbers by switching from a strikeout pitcher to a control pitcher? I don’t think so. It’s insulting to Maddux’s career to say otherwise.</p>

<p>All of that to say that that no, Kershaw can’t and won’t become Maddux-esque. Maddux is one of a kind. So let’s stop using the <em>Greg Maddux Comp</em> so much. Mad Dog deserves better.</p>
