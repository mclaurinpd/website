description: Who am I and what do I do?
---

Hi! My name is Phillip McLaurin and I'm a back-end — and sometimes front-end — developer at Corning Inc. in Wilmington, North Carolina. Much of my time is spent developing and updating message adapters for the plant's manufacturing exection system(MES). I'm proficient in Java, C, C#, VB.NET, and Python. Occasionally I dabble in Ruby and R. My coding interests vary, but I am most intrigued by using code for statiscal analysis.

In my free time I enjoy watching baseball and consuming the statistics the come with it, listening to and creating music, speedcubing, and traveling.
